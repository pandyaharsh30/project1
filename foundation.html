        <h5> FOUNDATION</h5>
        <P class="para"> FutureBeeAI is a leading service-providing company in the field of AI data sourcing and Localization. The
            journey started with the founderâ€™s freelancing and now FutureBeeAI is a trusted team of thousands of
            passionate people.</P><hr>

            <P class="para"> We are serving AI startups and organisations with our biggest OTS training AI datasets, custom training data
            collection and various annotation services. FutureBeeAI wants to contribute to the development of a
            human-centric AI-quipped world and we are very keen to collaborate with organisations working for this
            mission</P><hr>

            <P class="para"> FutureBeeAI wants to build a world where reality is much more than our current ideas. We all want to
            contribute to the idea of responsible AI so that the machine will no longer be a strange machine in near
            future but become our good friend who will not only understand & respond to us in our language but also
            understand our emotions and feelings.</p><hr>

            <P class="para">   We believe that language is not only a medium of expression but a medium of understanding and approaching a
            vast culture. We want to make sure that nobody should be leftover from any technology, idea, or content just
            because of the language barrier and that's why we want to create an equal lingual world by providing
            world-class linguistic services. We have a proven track record of accelerating and scaling the AI/ML model
            creation process for companies working in the field of ASR, NLP, MT, Computer vision, or any other
            technology of AI/ML.</P><hr>
